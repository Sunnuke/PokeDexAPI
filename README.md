# PokeDexAPI

An app for Pokemon fans that enables users to explore the entire library of the Pokemon universe and see their stats and alternate versions.

In this project I will practice using JavaScript in an effort to express an API. The API that I will be using is the PokeAPI, can be found at:  https://pokeapi.co/  ; for this project I will be assisted by Justin Kim (GitHub: angle943).
